Options Menu:
The Options Menu allows the user to make custom selections to alter their game play.
The first two selections change the type of game. The user can select one of the two game styles
*Menu Option 1) Old School: Allows the user to play a traditional version of the snake.
*Menu Option 2) New School: Allows the user to play an updated version of the game. This update version of the game includes Bad Snakes and possible Power Fruit.

After the user has selected to one of these two types of games, they will be directed to select their difficulty for the given game type.
The user will be allowed to select from either "Easy," "Hard," or "2020." The difficulty both alters the speed at which the
snake travels as well as the BadSnakes if the user selected "New School" game style.

The remaining options in this menu apply to any game type and difficulty.
*Menu Option 3) Color: This selection presents the user with a robust option of color choices. They can select from either set color combos or customize the colors.
Custom colors will be covered later in this document.
*Menu Option 4) Game Size: The user can select from three game sizes, "Small," Medium," or "Large." The size also effects the score multiplier.
*Menu Option 5) Return: Selecting this saves all settings and will be applied to the userâ€™s next game.



Play Game:
Navigate the snake using WSDA (w = up, s = down, a = left, d = right) or using the arrow keys. It is important to note that the arrow.
keys introduce a delay to the response time.

- Old School: The user must utilize controls to avoid running into the edges of the game board. They must try to navigate to a
fruit to increase their score. This also increases their length, causing it to become more difficult to survive on a given map as
the snake also has to avoid eating itself.

- New School: This game feature offers the same experience as "Old School" but with some additional added difficulty and perks.
While the user is attempting to navigate the map, BadSnakes will be periodically sent across the map from any direction and random starting locations.
The user must navigate their snake to avoid these BadSnakes.

***Note: It is only the head that must be avoided. The snake's tail can reside on the same tile as a BadSnake without any negative side effects.

***Note: BadSnakes grow in size the more turns the user makes. To avoid extremely long BadSnakes, reduce the number of time Snake changes directions.

In addition, this style of game play offers power fruit. At random, a fruit will be labeled as power fruit.
If the snakes eats a power fruit, the score multiplier for that game is doubled for a short period of time.
The time period for which the score is doubled is different based on map size. In addition, the snake is invulnerable to attacking snakes. 

Once a user has met an end game condition, the game engine will evaluate whether or not the user achieved a high score for their given difficulty.
If the user did achieve a high score, they will be allowed to enter their initials as long as their initials are not on the security profile.
