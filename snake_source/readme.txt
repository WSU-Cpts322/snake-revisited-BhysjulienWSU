Snake! Revisited

Snake offers a throwback to the traditional game with some possible twists. 
The user is allowed to play either the traditional snake with various difficulties, or 
a new and improved version with some added features. 



Generic Menu Control: 
For many of the menus available in Snake! Revisited support several types of navigation. 
The user can either use the traditional WSDA (w = up, s = down, a = left, d = right) or 
can use the arrow keys found on a taditional keyboard. Once a desired option is selected, 
the user hits [Enter] to make their selection. 



Main Menu: 
Here the user is allowed to.... 
1) Launch a game of Snake based on current settings 
2) Navigate to the Options Menu to customize their game play. 
3) View all current High Scores.

Additional Features from the Main Menu: 

1) Built in Easter-Egg game play. The user may type "WSU" (case sensitive). 
2) Enter admin options for security profiles. To access type "admin" (case sensitive) 



Options Menu: 
The Options Menu allows the user to make custom selections to later their game play. 
The first two selections change the type of game. The user can select one of the two game styles 
*Menu Option 1) Old School: Allows the user to play a traditional version of the snake. 
*Menu Option 2) New School: Allows the user to play an updated version of the game. This update version of the game inlcudes Bad Snakes and possible Power Fruit. 

After the user has selected to one of these two types of games, they will be directed to select their difficulty for the given game. 
The user will be allowed to select from either "Easy," "Hard," or "2020." The difficulty both alters the speed at which the 
snake travels as well as the BadSnakes if the user selected "New School" game stype. 

The remaining options in this menu apply to any game type and difficulty. 
*Menu Option 3) Color: This selection presents the user with a robust option of colour choices. They can select from either set color combos, or customize the colors. 
Custom colors will be covered later in this document. 
*Menu Option 4) Game Size: The user can select from three game sizes, "Small," Medium," or "Large." The size also effects the score multiplier.
*Menu Option 5) Return: Selecting this saves all settings and will be applied to the users next game. 



Play Game: 
Navigate the snake using WSDA (w = up, s = down, a = left, d = right) or using the arrow keys. It is important to note that the arrow
keys intoduce a delay to the response time. 

- Old School: The user must utilize controls to avoid running into the edges of the game board. They must try to navigate to a 
fruit to increase their score. This also increases their length, causing it to become more difficult to survive on a given map as 
the snake also has to avoid eating itself. 

- New School: This game feature offers the same experience as "Old School" but with some additional added difficulty and perks. 
While the user is attempt to naviagate the map, BadSnakes will be periodically sent across the map from any direction, and random starting locations. 
The user must naviage their snake to avoid these badSnakes. 

***Note: It is only the head that must be avoided. The snake's tail can reside on the same tile as a BadSnake without any negative side effects. 

***Note: BadSnakes grow in size the more turns the user makes. To avoid extremely long BadSnakes, reduce the number of time Snake changes directions. 

In addtion this stype of game play offers power fruit. At random, a fruit will be labled as power fruit. There are no visual clues to the user 
as to whether or not a given fruit is a power fruit. If the snakes eats a power fruit, the score multiplier for that game is doubled for a short period of time. 
The time period for which the score is doubled is different based on map size. 

Once a user has met a end game condition, the game engine will evaluate whether or not the user achieved a highscore for their given difficulty. 
If the user did achieve a high score they will be allowed to enter their intials as long as their intials are not on the security profile. 




Special Menus: 

Custome Color: Available from the color menu. 
This allows the user to enter nearly any color combo. Make note of the legened on the right to determine which letters should be entered for a given color
**Note: This menu option only supports WSDA navigation. 

Admin Menu; Available from the main menu by typing "admin" 
This menu allows a user to add or remove users from the protection profile. First select "A" to add a set of initials to the protection profile. 
Or enter "D" to delete a user from the profile. Once a letter has been entered select [Enter]. This will then allow you to enter a set of initials. 
To quit this menu enter "Q" instead of "D" or "A". 
**Note: This menu does not support "q" to quit the game entirely as "q" could be a potential entry.
